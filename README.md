## Project Description:

This project is an interactive web map that shows the values of key environmental hazard variables in each Washington state census tract. The map is three-dimensional and represents the values of a given ecological hazard in a census tract through the height and color of the representing polygon. For instance, if the map were depicting the average PM 2.5 concentration in a census tract, it would show low concentrations with a short and light-colored polygon, while high concentrations would be shown with a tall and dark-colored polygon. The ecological hazard being shown is changeable via a menu on the left-hand side of the map, which can be clicked on to change the dataset being shown on the map. Additionally, the map displays more in-depth information on a given census tract through click-event support, wherein a census tract can be clicked on to show its valueâ€™s place in the larger variable distribution. To enable easy navigation of the geographical area of interest, there is a drop-down menu with city/area names that can be clicked on to recenter the map on that location.

Though the map is the most essential part of our project, the map is only a single page on our more extensive website, which has 4 pages in total. The first page provides a disclaimer and an introduction of the visual strategies and datasets, the second page contains the actual map, the third page includes information on the datasets (with recommended, but unused datasets), and the fourth page provides some context on our team.

## Project Goal:

We hope that by representing the values of different environmental hazards throughout Washington state we can make a significant point about the distribution of the variables and possible inequalities associated with that distribution. We additionally aim to provide other geographers and climate-minded individuals to gather their own datasets, make their own projects, and in general create digital objects that make visible environmental inequalities.

## Data Sources:

All of the datasets used in this project are drawn from the environmental health disparities section of the Washington Geospatial Open Data Portal https://geo.wa.gov/. The datasets from the open data portal each essentially describe the prevalence of a certain environmental hazard in all Washington State census tracts for a given year. Included below is a brief description and link to each individual dataset used.

The first [dataset](https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WADOH::pm2-5-concentration-current-version/about) contains information on the prevalence of pm 2.5 micro meter air pollution within each Washington state census tract.

The second [dataset](https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WADOH::lead-risk-from-housing-current-version/about 
) contains information on the number and percentage of housing units in each Washington state census tract that have lead in them.

The third [dataset](https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WADOH::proximity-to-heavy-traffic-roadways-current-version/about) contains information on the proximity of census tracts to heavy-traffic roadways.

The fourth [dataset](https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WADOH::ozone-concentration-current-version/about
) contains information on the ozone concentration of Washington state census tracts.

The fifth [dataset](https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WADOH::nox-diesel-emissions-annual-tons-km2-current-version/about ) contains information on the diesel emission exposures of each Washington state census tract.

The sixth [dataset](https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WADOH::toxic-releases-from-facilities-rsei-model-current-version/about ) contains information on the weighted toxic emissions for each Washington state census tract.

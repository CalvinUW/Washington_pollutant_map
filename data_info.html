    <h2>Variable Description:</h2>
    <h4>Count_</h4>
    <h6>- From PM2.5 Concentration (Current Version)</h6>
    <p>The three-year mean concentration of annual particulate matter particles with diameters 2.5 micrometers and
        smaller for 2009-2011.
        <br>
        <br>
        Particulate matter is a chemical mixture of particles with diameters that are 2.5 micrometers and smaller. These
        particles come from many different sources such as residential wood combustion, wildfires and other outdoor
        burning, dust, industrial point sources, commercial cooking, and motor vehicles. Particulate matter can be
        emitted directly from a source or form through secondary chemical reactions of chemicals like sulfur oxides and
        nitrogen oxides. The composition of PM2.5 depends on seasonal periods, geography, and weather patterns, on both
        local and regional scales.
        <br>
        <br>
        Particulate matter is extremely hazardous because the small particles can penetrate the bloodstream and be
        absorbed deep into organs, resulting in poor health outcomes. The elderly, those with preexisting respiratory
        health conditions, and children are most susceptible to the significant health impacts posed by PM2.5.

    <h2>Treatment:</h2>
    <p>In order to allow for the data from each dataset to be readily comparable across different scales, each variable
        used in the map was normalized using min-max normalization. The normalized values of each variable were then
        used to get the height and color of census tract polygons. Though the normalized values were used for
        representing the progression of values, the values displayed on the popup windows of the map are the actual
        values in the original dataset.
        <br>
        <br>
        Aside from min-max normalization, the geometry of the data was clipped using a <a
            href=”https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html”>
            cartographic boundary map<a> from the United States census bureau. Clipping was performed on the data so as
            to limit census tract extents to only land area, thereby improving geographic legibility.</p>
